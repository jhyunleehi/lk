Task which is currently executed on CPU is accessible through `current` macro which actually calls function to get task from run-queue of CPU where it is called. To get current pointer in SystemTap, use `task_current()`. You can also get pointer to a `task_struct` using `pid2task()` function which accepts PID as its first argument. Task tapset provides several functions similar for functions used as [Probe Context](https://myaut.github.io/dtrace-stap-book/lang/context.html). They all get pointer to a `task_struct` as their argument:

- `task_pid()` and `task_tid()` –- ID of the process ID (stored in `tgid` field) and thread (stored in `pid` field) respectively. Note that kernel most of the kernel code doesn't check cached `pid` and `tgid` but use namespace wrappers.
- `task_parent()` –- returns pointer to a parent process, stored in `parent`/`real_parent` fields
- `task_state()` –- returns state bitmask stored in `state`, such as `TASK_RUNNING` (0), `TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE` (1), `TASK_UNINTTERRUPTIBLE` (2). Last 2 values are for sleeping or waiting tasks –- the difference that only interruptible tasks may receive signals.
- `task_execname()` –- reads executable name from `comm` field, which stores base name of executable path. Note that `comm` respects symbolic links.
- `task_cpu()` –- returns CPU to which task belongs



There are several other useful fields in `task_struct`:

- `mm` (pointer to `struct mm_struct`) refers to a address space of a process. For example, `exe_file` (pointer to `struct file`) refers to executable file, while `arg_start` and `arg_end` are addresses of first and last byte of argv passed to a process respectively
- `fs` (pointer to `struct fs_struct`) contains filesystem information: `path` contains working directory of a task, `root` contains root directory (alterable using `chroot` system call)
- `start_time` and `real_start_time` (represented as `struct timespec` until 3.17, replaced with `u64` nanosecond timestamps) –- *monotonic* and *real* start time of a process.
- `files` (pointer to `struct files_struct`) contains table of files opened by process
- `utime` and `stime` (`cputime_t`) contain amount of time spent by CPU in userspace and kernel respectively. They can be accessed through Task Time tapset.
